# Work-Day-Planner
The client has tasked me with creating a web app that can accurately track their plans for the business day. 
Along with tracking the plans for the day the client will be met with a responsive UI. In the UI the text input areas will change due to the time of day
(ie: if the task that is either for the future past or present will have an corresponding color on it.)
The client will be met with a header that will display the current day of the plan. 
Wehn the client enters text in the input field the content that they have just added will be saved to local storage and will be able to be seen again after a page reload.
